## Latitude and Longitude

Latitude and Longitude are used to give coordinates to locations on the Earth's surface.

**Latitude** is the North-South position and runs from 90 to -90. 0 is the Equator.

**Longitude** is the East-West position and runs from -180 to 180. 0 is the Prime Meridian which runs through Greenwich in London, UK.

Coordinates are usually given as **(latitude, longitude)**.

The coordinates of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich are: (51.48, 0).

Notice that the latitude (North-South) position is given first.
