## Latitude and Longitude

Latitude and longitude are used to give coordinates to locations on the Earth's surface.

Latitude indicates the position along the north-south axies, and can be any value between 90 and -90. 0 marks the equator.

Longitude indicates the position along the east-west axis, and can be any value between -180 and 180. 0 marks the prime meridian, which runs through Greenwich in London, UK.

Coordinates are given as **(latitude, longitude)**. The coordinates of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich are (51.48, 0). As you can see, the latitude (north-south) position is given first.
